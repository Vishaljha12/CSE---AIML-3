        <h2><li>Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warns US: Selling AI chips to China is "mortgaging our future"</li></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has issued a warning in relation to the US AI chips. Speaking at the Axios AI+ DC Summit, the Anthropic CEO has urged the US government to again consider its plans to allow chipmakers Nvidia and AMD to continue selling their advanced AI chips to China.Amodie's AI startup is backed by Jeff Bezos stressed on the fact that US's dominance in the chip technology is its las strategic edge over China. "It may be the only advantage we have because we're so far behind on things like munitions, ship building," Amodei said, adding, "It is mortgaging our future as a country to sell these chips to China".</li>
        </ul>
    <h1>National Security Risk</h1>
    <p>The comments from Amodei comes at the time when geopolitical tensions are rising and a controversial US proposal would allow chip exports to China, with a portion of the revenue redirected to the government. While this move from the US government aims to balance economic interest and national security, Amodei feels that this decision could lead catastrophic consequences. "This could control the fate of nations. This could control the future of freedom and democracy," he warned.</p>

    <h1>Clash with Trump administration</h1>
    <p>Amodei's sharp stance on the matter of US AI chips has placed him at odds with the Trump administration, which has taken a more permissive approach to AI chip exports than some industry leaders expected. He criticized the policy shift, calling it: "The single most disastrous national security decision made in this term"</p>

    <h1>China's strategic push</h1>
    <p>The warning from Anthropic CEO is followed by China's ban on major tech firms for purchasing Nvidia's latest Al chipset. Along with this, China has also launched its anti-dumping investigation into the U.S. semiconductor sector, further escalating the tech rivalry.</p>

    <h2>India set to host 2030 centenary Commonwealth Games</h2>
    <p>India is set to host the centenary Commonwealth Games in 2030 - the second time in 20 years that the event will have been held in the world's most populous nation.

The city of Ahmedabad in the west of the country has been chosen ahead of Abuja in Nigeria by an evaluation commission from governing body Commonwealth Sport.
And the decision to hold the Games there in five years time is now expected to be ratified at the organisation's general assembly in Glasgow on 26 November.
Ahmedabad can boast the Narendra Modi Stadium - the largest in the world, with a capacity of 132,000 - which hosted the Cricket World Cup final in 2023.
The city has a population in excess of five million people, and has even been suggested as a potential bidder to host a future Olympic Games.
"We see the 2030 Games as a powerful opportunity to inspire our youth, strengthen international partnerships and contribute to a shared future across the Commonwealth," said Dr. P T Usha, president of Commonwealth Games Association India.
The Games first visited India in 2010 when Delhi hosted.
It is the second time Abuja has missed out on staging the Commonwealths, having been overlooked for the 2014 edition in favour of Glasgow.
And it also means Africa's wait to hold the event for a first time will continue.</p>

    The news looks set to end fears that Glasgow 2026 might be the last-ever Games, with Scotland's largest city having stepped in after the Australian state of Victoria withdrew for financial reasons.
That came after Birmingham took on the 2022 event after the South African city of Durban pulled out.
However, a reimagined format - with fewer sports, athletes and venues - has lessened the cost and enticed India, Nigeria and a handful of other countries to make their pitch to welcome the 74 Commonwealth Sport nations and territories.
A Commonwealth Sport statement said they "assessed candidate cities against a wide range of criteria“ and have “agreed to develop a strategy for supporting Nigeria's hosting ambitions for future Games, including consideration for 2034."
Meanwhile, Glasgow 2026 chair George Black said the news “marks a significant milestone”. He added that they “stand ready to create a powerful bond between Scotland and India that will be the bridge to the Games of the future”.
The 2030 Games will mark the centenary of the inaugural event held in Hamilton, Canada, in 1930.
